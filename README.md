## Zansat VIII Arduino Repository

This repository stores code that will be written onto the arduino pro mini on board of our ZansatVIII Cansat-type Probe

### Things managed by the aforementioned code:
- **QMC5883L** for sensing direction
- **ATGM336336H-5N31** as our GPS chip
- **A Servo System** For Directing the fall of the probe by adjusting the parachute

### Libraries used:
- Own Chiptemp library
- QMC5883LCompass library 
- Tinygps
- Other basic Arduino libraries (SPI,Wire,SoftwareSerial )
