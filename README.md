## Zansat VIII Arduino Repository

This repository stores code that will be written onto the arduino pro mini on board of our ZansatVIII Cansat-type Probe

### Things managed by the aforementioned code:
- **BME280** for Humidity, Air pressure and Temperature Sensing Capabilities
- **HMC5883L** for sensing direction
- **ATGM336336H-5N31** as our GPS chip
- **A Servo System** For Directing the fall of the probe by adjusting the parachute

### Libraries used:
- Adafruit libraries for the BME and HMC sensors
- Tinygps
- Other basic Arduino libraries (SPI,Wire,SoftwareSerial )
