## Zansat VIII Arduino Repository

This repository stores code that will be written onto the arduino pro mini on board of our ZansatVIII Cansat-type Probe

###Things managed by the aforementioned code:
-**BME280** for Humidity, Air pressure and Temperature Sensing Capabilities
-**HMC5883L** for sensing direction
-**ATGM336336H-5N31** as our GPS chip
-**A Servo System** For Directing the fall of the probe by adjusting the parachute

###Libraries used:
-Adafruit libraries for the BME and HMC sensors
-Tinygps
-Other basic Arduino libraries (SPI,Wire,SoftwareSerial )
